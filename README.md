# SummarizeYourself
A creative poject where the main goal was to create a learning management system for kids by implementing creative ideas.<br>

A website was made in order to show the difference between Resume, CV and Biodata to kids. The website is not complete but the documentation (included in the documentation folder) gives an overview of the idea as the main goal was creativity and not implementation.<br>

PS: This was a competition arranged by Mozilla Firefox where we participated in a group of 3 members. The goal of the competition was to make a creative way to allow children to learn difficult things. The team was awarded the second prize for this idea.
